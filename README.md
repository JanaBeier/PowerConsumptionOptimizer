# Power Consumption Optimizer

A privacy-preserving power consumption optimization platform built with Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling confidential energy analysis without exposing sensitive consumption data.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
This project leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** to perform computations on encrypted power consumption data without ever decrypting it. This revolutionary approach ensures:

- **Complete Privacy**: Power consumption patterns remain encrypted throughout the entire analysis process
- **Confidential Computation**: Mathematical operations are performed directly on encrypted values
- **Zero Knowledge**: Neither the smart contract nor the network can see actual consumption figures
- **Trustless Analysis**: Users can verify optimization recommendations without revealing private data

### Privacy-Preserving Energy Analytics
Traditional energy monitoring systems expose sensitive household data, revealing daily routines, occupancy patterns, and lifestyle information. Our FHE-powered solution solves this by:

- **Encrypted Data Collection**: All power readings are encrypted before leaving the device
- **Private Optimization**: Energy efficiency algorithms run on encrypted data
- **Confidential Recommendations**: Optimization suggestions are generated without data exposure
- **Secure Aggregation**: Grid-level insights are computed while preserving individual privacy
